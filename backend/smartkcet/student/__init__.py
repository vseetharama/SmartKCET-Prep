"""Student-facing operations (exam selection, submission, dashboard).

This module hosts the ``/api/student`` router that is mounted in
:mod:`smartkcet.main`.

Mounted endpoints:

* ``GET  /api/student/ping``                       — RBAC smoke-test.
* ``GET  /api/student/exams``                      — task 7.5 published-exam listing.
* ``POST /api/student/submit``                     — task 8.1 score + persist.
* ``GET  /api/student/exams/{exam_set_id}/status`` — task 8.3 already-completed check.
* ``GET  /api/student/submissions``                — task 8.5 history list.
* ``GET  /api/student/submissions/{id}``           — task 8.5 detail drawer.
* ``GET  /api/student/leaderboard/me``             — task 10.9 personal rank + top-3.
