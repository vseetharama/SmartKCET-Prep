"""Preservation property tests for database seeding idempotency.

This module contains preservation tests for Bug 2: Database seeding not 
called automatically on startup.

**Validates: Requirement 3.3**

Preservation Requirement: When subscription_plans table already has plans, 
subsequent calls to seed_subscription_plans() return 0 and add no new rows.
Existing plan data (name, price, feature_flags) is never modified.

CRITICAL: This test MUST PASS on unfixed code to confirm we've captured 
the baseline idempotent behavior that must be preserved. This is the 
preservation guarantee — we verify the non-buggy behavior path (plans 
already exist) continues to work correctly.

Observation-First Methodology:
1. OBSERVE: When seed_subscription_plans() is called once, 6 plans are created
2. OBSERVE: When seed_subscription_plans() is called a second time, what happens?
   - Does it return 0? (idempotent)
   - Does it add new plans? (should not)
   - Are existing plan data modified? (should not)
3. WRITE: Property-based test that captures this pattern
4. VERIFY: Test passes on unfixed code (confirms baseline captured)
